some of this code is absolutely a mess! first time doing advent of code so I'm not too focused on optimisation, just getting it done. 

generally part 1 and part 2 are separate files, but occasionally there's just one file because I only needed to change a line or two to solve part 2 (i'm looking at you day 13 and your lovely little simultaneous equations)
